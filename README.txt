Fortships is a flight mod with an emphasis on maneuverability rather than constant micromanagement. Inspired by Airships: Conquer the Skies, Fortships uses the powerful lift capabilities of Suspendium to keep your ships aloft as well as easy-to-use altitude adjustment.

Added in this mod are a number of new devices, weapons, and mechanics designed to make aerial combat exciting and engaging. 
Key components include the Fortship Controller to command your vessels, the control-groupable Altitude Controller to operate Suspendium Chambers, and the Jets to propel ships left and right.
New weaponry specifically designed for high-altitude engagements like the Flamethrower, Carpet Bombs, Hanging Flak, and the Area Denial System fill the roles that existing weapons struggle with.

Thanks to the many contributors that have helped mold Fortships into its current state: 
SamsterBirdies for creating Flying Forts,
LancenShield for the mod preview and additional sprites,
Yellow Submarine for the Air Brake device,
Land Planters and Wak for code contributions.
and a great thank you to all the players who've done playtesting.
